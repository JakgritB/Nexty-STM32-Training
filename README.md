# Toyota Nexty STM32 Training & Mini Project

## Project Overview  
This repository contains my training projects using STM32 microcontrollers, conducted during the Nexty-STM32 training course.  
In particular, the folder **MiniProjectDF-AddOn** contains my mini-project, a complete embedded system project demonstrating my skills in STM32 MCU programming, peripheral control, and real-world embedded development workflows.  
The other folders (e.g. ProjectX_663040111-9_Jakgrit) are exercises and final assignments from the training course.

## Key Highlights / What I Learned  
- Configuring and using STM32 peripherals: GPIO, UART, Timers, PWM, Interrupts  
- Developing firmware with either HAL or bare-metal, ensuring efficient resource usage  
- Organising code structure for embedded projects (separate modules / clean folder layout)  
- Hardware-software integration and testing workflows  
- Debugging and testing on actual STM32 boards  
- Understanding embedded system concepts: real-time control, low-level programming, peripheral management  

## Tech Stack & Environment  
- **MCU / Board:** STM32  
- **Language:** C  
- **IDE:** STM32CubeIDE  
- **Peripherals used:** GPIO, UART, Timers, PWM, External Interrupts, ADC/DAC (if applicable)
